## ðŸ”¨ Technical details
- Server must use the [PaperMC](https://papermc.io) and [Nitori](https://github.com/Gensokyo-Reimagined/Nitori) software.
- It's recommended to use a proxy software like [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) or [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/).
- It's highly recommended to enable the server [resource pack](https://cdn.marow.dev/content/KaelaEventPack.zip), otherwise stuff might be a little weird.

## ðŸ”¨ Resource Pack
- Resource pack can be downloaded [here](https://cdn.marow.dev/content/KaelaEventPack.zip)
- Resources are on Minecraft version **1.21.1**.

## ðŸ”¨ Warning
- This server setup was made for [COVER Corporation](https://cover-corp.com/en/company) & [hololive production](https://hololive.hololivepro.com/en).
- The server is not made to be easy to install outside of the event host.
- This page is going to change by the time!
